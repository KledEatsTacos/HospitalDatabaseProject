# Hospital Database System

This is my Database Management Systems project. It is a hospital management system where you can add patients, schedule appointments, and simulate billing and payments. 

## Features
- Add and manage patient records.
- Schedule and manage appointments.
- Simulate billing and payments.

## Notes
- The SQL code is included in the solution in a file named `sql.txt`.
- The interface is built with C#.

This project was created in a short timeframe, so it is missing looooooooots and lots of features that I was supposed to add.. how very unprofessional of me...
