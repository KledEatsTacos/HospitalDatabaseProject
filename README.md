This is my Database Management Systems project. It is quite bad, I know, but I made it in a few days only, so...

It is basically a hospital system where you can add patients, give them appointments, and simulate billing and payments
The SQL code is included in the solution, in a .txt file named sql.txt. and the interface was made with C# (My most hated language)
